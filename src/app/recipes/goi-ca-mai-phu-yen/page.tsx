    subtitle: 'Tiny silverfish from the Sông C?u bay cured for minutes in lime juice and m?m nhi until they turn from translucent silver to opaque white — tossed with green mango, rau ram, roasted peanuts, and toasted sesame in the raw fish salad that Phú Yên fishermen eat immediately after the morning net comes in.',

    intro: `G?i cá mai is the raw silverfish salad of the Phú Yên coast — a preparation built around cá mai, the tiny translucent silver fish (likely Anchoviella or Stolephorus species) caught in vast quantities in the protected waters of Sông C?u bay and the coastal lagoons between Tuy Hòa and Ð?i Lãnh. Cá mai are small — rarely longer than 5-6cm — nearly transparent when alive, and so delicate that they begin to deteriorate within hours of leaving the water. This fragility is the quality that makes g?i cá mai what it is: the fish must be so fresh that it can be eaten raw, cured only by the lime juice and m?m nhi that the fishermen mix them with immediately after the morning catch. The curing takes 5-7 minutes — longer than for the larger shrimp tái preparations because the small fish need more time for the lime acid to penetrate the flesh — and produces a fish that has gone from transparent silver to opaque white throughout, with a texture that is simultaneously firm (from the protein denaturation) and delicate (from the small size). The salad components in g?i cá mai are the classic Phú Yên raw seafood formula: green mango for sourness and crunch, rau ram in the generous Phú Yên quantity, roasted peanuts for fat and texture, toasted sesame for warmth, shallots soaked in ice water for mild allium bite. The m?m nhi in the curing and dressing makes this specifically Phú Yên — the first-press fish sauce adds a depth to the raw fish preparation that the fish alone does not possess. G?i cá mai is eaten at Sông C?u harbor restaurants in the late morning, at the tables closest to where the boats come in, where the fish arrive in the bowl having been in the water less than two hours earlier.`,

            title: 'Freshness assessment — the most critical step',
            description: 'Examine the cá mai carefully before proceeding. They should: smell of clean sea and nothing else; be nearly transparent when held to light; have bright, clear eyes (if visible at this small size); feel firm when pressed. The flesh should feel slightly resistant, not soft or yielding. If any batch of fish smells of anything other than clean sea — even a faint ammonia note — do not proceed with a raw preparation. Cook them instead. Freshness is not a preference here; it is the requirement that makes the dish safe and delicious.',
            tip: 'Cá mai are more perishable than almost any other fish because of their tiny size and thin skin. The window between optimal raw eating quality and no longer suitable for raw preparation is very short — 2-3 hours at room temperature, 4-6 hours refrigerated. If the fish were not live or near-live when purchased, they should not be eaten raw.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Clean and prepare the silverfish',
            description: 'Rinse the cá mai very gently in cold salted water. Because they are so small and delicate, they need only rinsing — no scaling, no gutting for fish this size (the internal organs are minimal and become part of the cured fish). Drain carefully. Place in a glass or ceramic bowl — not metal, which reacts with the lime juice.',
            tip: 'Handle cá mai with extreme gentleness — their flesh is so delicate that rough handling breaks the fish apart before the curing begins. Use the gentlest possible motion when rinsing and a light touch when tossing during the curing period.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Cure in lime and m?m nhi — 5-7 minutes exactly',
            description: 'Combine lime juice, m?m nhi, and sugar. Pour over the cá mai and toss very gently to coat. Set a timer for 5 minutes. At 5 minutes, check one fish: hold it to the light — the flesh should have turned from transparent silver to completely opaque white throughout. At 7 minutes the cure is complete. The fish will have gone from translucent to white, from raw-smelling to bright-lime-sea fragrance, and the texture will have firmed to something between raw and cooked. Drain, reserving 2 tablespoons of the curing liquid.',
            tip: 'The visual transformation of cá mai during curing is one of the most dramatic in Vietnamese raw preparation: the fish go in nearly transparent and come out completely white in 5-7 minutes. Watching this transformation is watching the lime acid denature the fish proteins in real time. The color change is the doneness indicator.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Assemble immediately',
            description: 'Combine the cured cá mai with julienned green mango, soaked shallots, rau ram, mint, perilla, spring onion, and sliced chili. Add the final dressing: m?m nhi, lime juice, sugar, sesame oil, and the reserved curing liquid. Toss very gently — the small cured fish break apart if handled roughly. The salad should show individual fish, not a fish paste.',
            tip: 'The gentle tossing technique for g?i cá mai is more critical than for g?i with larger proteins. Each fish needs to remain intact in the finished salad for both texture and presentation. Use a folding motion rather than tossing, working from the bottom of the bowl upward.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Plate and serve within 5 minutes',
            description: 'Transfer to a serving plate. Top with crushed peanuts, toasted sesame, and crispy fried shallots at the last moment. G?i cá mai must be eaten within 5-8 minutes of assembly — the cured fish continues to firm from the lime acid and the salad quickly loses its fresh character. Serve with sesame crackers, extra rau ram, and lime. To eat: spoon onto a cracker, dip edge in the remaining dressing on the plate, eat in one bite.',
            tip: 'The speed of service for g?i cá mai — prepare, assemble, serve, eat in one continuous motion — is part of the dish\'s identity. It is the food of fishermen eating immediately after the morning catch, not a dish that waits. At Sông C?u restaurants, the fish arrive at the table within minutes of the boat docking. That immediacy is what the dish is.',
