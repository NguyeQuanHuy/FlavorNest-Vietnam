    intro: `Trứng chiên mắm nhĩ lá é is the Phú Yên fried egg — a preparation that is structurally identical to the trứng chiên lá hẹ of southern Vietnam or the plain fried egg of any Vietnamese household, differentiated entirely by two ingredients: the mắm nhĩ beaten into the egg before frying rather than standard fish sauce, and the mắm nhĩ-lá é dipping sauce served alongside rather than a standard nước chấm. These two substitutions produce a completely different eating experience from the same basic technique. The mắm nhĩ in the egg provides the specific sweetness and depth of the first-press fish sauce that standard fish sauce at the same volume cannot — the egg tastes richer, more rounded, and more complex without tasting of a specific added ingredient. The mắm nhĩ-lá é dipping sauce is the preparation that makes this specifically and unmistakably Phú Yên: fresh lá é leaves pounded with mắm nhĩ, lime juice, and sugar produce a sauce that carries both the premium fish sauce depth and the wild citrus-pepper-camphor character of litsea cubeba simultaneously — a combination that exists in this form nowhere outside the province. The fried egg is the vehicle; the mắm nhĩ-lá é sauce is the point. Together they demonstrate what the province does with its most everyday preparation when its two signature ingredients — the first-press fish sauce and the wild mountain leaf — are applied simultaneously. In Phú Yên households, this is not considered a special dish. It is Tuesday dinner. The fact that it tastes specifically of the province is not a decision that was made — it is simply the result of using what is available and what is always on the table.`,

            title: 'Make the mắm nhĩ lá é sauce first',
            description: 'Pound fresh lá é leaves in a mortar until completely broken down — the leaves should release their oil and turn to a dark green paste. Add mắm nhĩ directly to the mortar and stir to combine with the pounded leaves. Transfer to a small bowl. Add fresh lime juice, sugar, and warm water. Add minced chili. Stir until the sugar dissolves. The sauce should be fragrant with the lá é oil, deep and complex from the mắm nhĩ, bright from the lime. Taste: all three elements should be detectable — the fish sauce depth, the lime brightness, and the lá é wild citrus note.',
            tip: 'Pounding the lá é leaves directly with the mắm nhĩ — rather than pounding the leaves separately and then adding the sauce — extracts the lá é oils more completely into the liquid. The mắm nhĩ acts as a solvent for the volatile litsea oils, producing a more aromatic sauce than one where the leaves were pounded dry and the sauce added later.',

            title: 'Beat the eggs with mắm nhĩ',
            description: 'Beat the eggs with mắm nhĩ, black pepper, and sugar until completely combined. Add the sliced spring onion and stir through. Taste the raw egg mixture from a spoon — it should taste richly eggy with a clear savory note from the mắm nhĩ. The difference from standard fish sauce at this stage is subtle but present: the mắm nhĩ produces a slightly sweeter, more rounded egg batter.',
            tip: 'The comparison between an egg beaten with mắm nhĩ and an egg beaten with standard fish sauce is most clearly tasted in the raw batter — the mắm nhĩ produces a batter that smells of egg and the sea simultaneously, while standard fish sauce produces a batter that smells more sharply of fish sauce. The cooked result reflects this difference.',

        {
            title: 'Fry at maximum heat — 90 seconds undisturbed',
            description: 'Heat oil in a wok or pan over maximum heat until smoking. Pour the egg mixture in one motion. Do not touch for 90 seconds — the edges will blister into the crispy lacework specific to the high-oil Vietnamese frying technique. After 90 seconds the edges are crispy, the center soft. Fold in half with a spatula. Slide onto a plate immediately.',
            tip: 'The blistered edge of trứng chiên mắm nhĩ lá é has a slightly richer, more golden character than the same technique applied to eggs beaten with standard fish sauce — the mắm nhĩ\'s higher amino acid content produces more pronounced Maillard caramelization at the egg-oil interface. The edge is visually more golden and more deeply flavored.',

        {
            title: 'Serve with the mắm nhĩ lá é sauce — two ways',
            description: 'Serve the folded omelette with the mắm nhĩ lá é sauce in individual small bowls, steamed rice, fresh lá é leaves, rau răm, and sesame crackers. Two ways to eat: RICE WAY — spoon omelette pieces over rice, drizzle the mắm nhĩ lá é sauce over each spoonful. CRACKER WAY — break a piece of omelette onto a sesame cracker, add a raw lá é leaf, dip in the sauce. The cracker way is the more specifically Phú Yên of the two — the sesame cracker extending the province\'s eating ritual into its most everyday meal.',
            tip: 'The mắm nhĩ lá é sauce served with a plain fried egg is the clearest expression of the Phú Yên philosophy in the entire recipe collection: the province takes its most humble preparation and makes it provincial not by changing the technique but by changing the condiment. The technique is universal; the condiment is Phú Yên. This is the cooking identity of the province in one dish.',
