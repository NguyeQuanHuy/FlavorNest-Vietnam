    intro: `Long Xuyên is the capital of An Giang province — a river city at the edge of the Mekong floodplain where Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Cham Muslim community overlap on the same street corner. Its com t?m is not famous the way Saigon's is, but among An Giang locals it is a point of quiet pride: the pork chop marinade runs deeper (more fish sauce, more garlic, longer time), the broken rice is steamed then rested until each grain separates cleanly, and the nu?c m?m dipping sauce is made with warm pork bone broth instead of plain warm water — a small distinction that changes everything.\n\nThe dish is eaten from 5am at Long Xuyên market, where vendors have the pork chops already marinated and the charcoal lit before sunrise. The grilled smoke mixes with river fog. The m? hành (spring onion oil) is made fresh every two hours. Regulars do not need to order — the vendor knows their plate.\n\nThis recipe documents the An Giang preparation with the broth-based dipping sauce and the double-rest rice method. It is not faster than Saigon com t?m. It is better.`,

            title: `Marinate the pork chops — minimum 4 hours`,
            description: `Combine fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, honey, minced garlic, shallots, black pepper, sesame oil, and neutral oil in a bowl. Whisk until sugar dissolves. Score the pork chops with shallow diagonal cuts on both sides — this prevents curling on the grill and helps the marinade penetrate. Coat chops thoroughly, massage marinade into the scores. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours. Overnight is standard in Long Xuyên.`,
            tip: `The higher fish sauce ratio (3 tbsp vs Saigon's typical 2 tbsp) is intentional — An Giang pork chops are meant to taste deeply savoury before the sweetness of the grill caramelisation arrives. Do not reduce it.`,
        },
        {
            title: `Cook the broken rice — two-rest method`,
            description: `Rinse broken rice three times in cold water until water runs nearly clear. Combine with 480 ml water and salt in a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a boil uncovered, then reduce heat to the lowest setting, cover tightly, and cook 12 minutes. Remove from heat — do not lift the lid — and rest 10 minutes. Then spread rice onto a wide tray or baking sheet in a thin layer. Fan or leave uncovered for 5 minutes. This double-rest separates the grains completely and prevents clumping. Return to pot to keep warm.`,
            tip: `The tray-spreading step is what An Giang vendors do that most home cooks skip. Broken rice starch is different from whole grain — it needs air to release steam or it becomes paste.`,
        },
        {
            title: `Make the m? hành`,
            description: `Place sliced spring onions in a heatproof bowl with salt. Heat neutral oil in a small saucepan until it just begins to shimmer — about 180°C. Pour hot oil directly over the spring onions in one motion. It will sizzle and spit — this is correct. Stir once. The onions will soften and turn bright green. Use immediately or within 2 hours. Do not reheat.`,
        },
        {
            title: `Make the Long Xuyên dipping sauce`,
            description: `Warm pork bone broth in a small saucepan — it should be hot but not simmering. Combine with fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, rice vinegar, minced garlic, and chili. Stir until sugar dissolves. Taste — it should be savoury-sweet with acid and heat in balance. The broth base gives it a roundness and body that water-based nu?c ch?m cannot match. Serve warm in individual bowls.`,
        },
        {
            title: `Grill the pork chops`,
            description: `Remove chops from fridge 20 minutes before cooking. If using charcoal (traditional): grill over medium-hot coals 4–5 minutes per side, pressing gently with tongs to ensure contact. Baste with any remaining marinade in the last 2 minutes. If using a grill pan: heat until very hot, lightly oil, cook 4 minutes per side over high heat without moving. The surface should char in places — the caramelised honey and sugar creates a dark crust that is expected, not burnt.`,
        },
        {
            title: `Fry the eggs`,
            description: `Fry eggs sunny-side up in neutral oil over medium heat until whites are set but yolks remain runny. The yolk will break over the rice when eating — this is part of the dish's texture, not a mistake.`,
        },
        {
            title: `Plate the Long Xuyên way`,
            description: `Mound broken rice on one side of the plate — it should be loose and separate, never packed. Place grilled pork chop leaning against the rice. Add fried egg, bì heo (pork skin), and ch? tr?ng alongside. Lay cucumber and tomato at the edge. Spoon m? hành generously over the rice and the pork chop surface. Scatter fried shallots. Serve with warm dipping sauce in a separate bowl. Everything on the plate should be hot.`,
            tip: `The m? hành goes on last, right before serving. It wilts quickly. Nu?c ch?m is never poured over the rice — it is always in a bowl on the side for dipping the pork chop bite by bite.`,
