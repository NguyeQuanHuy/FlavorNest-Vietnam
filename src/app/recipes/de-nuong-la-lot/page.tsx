    subtitle: 'Minced goat meat seasoned with lemongrass, galangal, and fish sauce, wrapped in lá lốt leaves and grilled over charcoal until the leaf chars and the goat inside caramelizes — the Ninh Bình preparation that transforms the strongest-flavored domestic meat into one of the most aromatic dishes in Vietnamese cooking.',

    intro: `Dê nướng lá lốt is the goat preparation most associated with Ninh Bình province — the limestone karst region south of Hanoi where goat herds graze on the rocky hillsides between the river and the mountains, and where the combination of the lean, mineral-flavored local goat with the aromatic wild pepper leaf produces a dish that is simultaneously the most rustic and the most sophisticated in the province's cooking. Goat meat has a specific flavor that divides opinion among Vietnamese diners in the same way that gamey meats divide opinion everywhere: those who grew up eating it consider it the richest and most satisfying of all meats; those who did not encounter it in childhood find it strong and unfamiliar. The technique of wrapping minced goat in lá lốt and grilling over charcoal is specifically designed to manage and harmonize the strong character of the meat: the lá lốt's aromatic oils penetrate the minced goat during cooking and provide a herbal, slightly camphor-like counterpoint to the gaminess; the charcoal heat caramelizes the outside of each roll while the inside steams; and the specific marinade — heavy on lemongrass, galangal, and fresh chili, with less sugar than the pork version — is calibrated to the goat rather than adapted from the pork lá lốt recipe. The result is a roll where the goat's strength becomes its virtue: the flavor is complex, deep, and unmistakable, with the lá lốt char providing exactly the aromatic frame it needs.`,

            title: 'Season the goat — rest 30 minutes',
            description: 'Combine minced goat meat with lemongrass paste, galangal paste, garlic, shallots, chili, fish sauce, sugar, black pepper, turmeric, sesame oil, and cornstarch. Mix vigorously with your hands for 3-4 minutes until the mixture becomes sticky and cohesive — the proteins in the meat bind together. The mixture should hold its shape when pressed into a ball. Rest covered for 30 minutes — the galangal and lemongrass need time to penetrate the goat.',
            tip: 'Galangal is the critical aromatic for dê nướng specifically. It has a different, sharper, more piney character than ginger and is specifically compatible with goat in a way that ginger is not. Do not substitute ginger for galangal in this preparation — the result will be noticeably different.',
        },

            title: 'Wrap in lá lốt — Ninh Bình technique',
            description: 'Take a large lá lốt leaf, shiny side down. Place a heaped tablespoon of goat mixture at the base of the leaf. Roll tightly from the bottom, encasing the meat completely. The roll should be firm and compact — about 5cm long. The lá lốt roll for dê nướng is typically slightly larger and fatter than for bò lá lốt, because the goat needs more time on the grill and a thicker roll maintains moisture through the longer cooking time.',
            tip: 'Make all rolls before lighting the charcoal — once the fire is ready, the grilling moves fast. Rolls left waiting after the fire is lit dry on the exterior and stick together. Prepare all rolls in 15 minutes, then build the fire.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Build the charcoal fire',
            description: 'Light hardwood charcoal and wait until fully ashed over — 25-30 minutes. The fire for dê nướng lá lốt should be slightly less intense than for seafood — goat needs a medium-hot fire that cooks the thicker roll through without burning the lá lốt exterior before the interior is done. The correct fire: hold your hand 15cm above the grill for 4-5 seconds before the heat is too intense.',
            tip: 'Goat rolls need slightly longer on the grill than pork or beef lá lốt rolls because the meat is denser and the rolls are slightly thicker. A slightly cooler fire compensates by giving the interior time to cook through before the lá lốt exterior goes from charred to burnt.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Grill until the leaf chars and the goat caramelizes',
            description: 'Place the rolls on the grill. Grill for 4-5 minutes per side — longer than pork or beef lá lốt. The lá lốt should develop deep char spots, not uniform blackening — specific black marks where the leaf has directly contacted the grill, with green remaining between. The smell as the leaf chars and the goat fat renders is the defining aromatic of Ninh Bình street food. The rolls are done when pressed firmly and feel solid throughout — no soft, yielding center.',
            tip: 'The firmness test is more important for dê nướng than for any other lá lốt preparation because undercooked goat has an unpleasant texture that the charred exterior can mask visually. Press each roll firmly at the 4-minute mark — if the center is still soft, grill 1-2 more minutes.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Make the Ninh Bình peanut sauce',
            description: 'Heat oil in a small pan. Fry minced garlic until golden. Add hoisin sauce, fish sauce, and sugar — stir until combined. Add water gradually, stirring, to a thick, pourable consistency. Add ground peanuts and stir in. Simmer 2 minutes. Remove from heat and add lime juice and minced chili. The sauce should be thicker than a dipping sauce — almost spreadable — so it coats each roll when dipped.',
            tip: 'The Ninh Bình peanut sauce for dê nướng is slightly thicker and slightly less sweet than the version served with nem lụi — the stronger flavor of goat requires a more assertive sauce that can stand alongside it without being overwhelmed.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Serve and assemble at the table',
            description: 'Plate the grilled rolls and scatter crushed peanuts over. Serve with the peanut sauce, rice paper, vermicelli, and all herbs. To eat: dampen a rice paper sheet, place vermicelli, herbs, and cucumber on the lower third. Place a dê nướng roll on top and roll loosely. Dip the entire roll in the peanut sauce. Eat in one or two bites. The raw lá lốt leaves served alongside the grilled rolls — eaten raw between bites — amplify the wild pepper character of the whole dish.',
            tip: 'Serving fresh raw lá lốt leaves alongside the cooked rolls is the technique that demonstrates the full range of the leaf\'s flavor. Cooked lá lốt is warm and slightly smoky; raw lá lốt is sharply aromatic. Together in the same meal — one cooked roll, one raw leaf eaten alongside — the lá lốt character is fully understood.',
