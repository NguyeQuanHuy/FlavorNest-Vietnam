    intro: `Bánh đa cua is the bowl that Hải Phòng people consider their greatest contribution to Vietnamese noodle soup culture — a preparation that uses bánh đa đỏ, the thick, flat, dark red rice noodles specific to the coastal city, in a crab and pork bone broth that owes something to bún riêu cua in its crab curd technique but is denser, more complex, and more assertively seasoned. The bánh đa noodles are the most distinctive element: made from a combination of rice flour and red rice that gives them their color, they are wider and thicker than bún (round rice vermicelli) and flat like pappardelle, with a slightly chewy, substantial texture that holds up in the rich broth without dissolving. The crab broth follows the pounded-and-strained technique of bún riêu — field crabs pounded to release their essence, strained, poured into the hot broth where the crab proteins set into floating curd — but the Hải Phòng version uses both crab curd and separately prepared chả cua (crab cake), which is steamed separately and sliced into the bowl. The finishing element that defines bánh đa cua above all others is the mỡ hành gấc — the shrimp paste oil, applied in a generous spoonful over the surface of each completed bowl, which transforms the broth immediately with its assertive, savory depth. Bánh đa cua Hải Phòng cannot be made in smaller steps or simplified — each element contributes something irreplaceable to the whole.`,

            title: 'Build the pork bone broth — 1.5 hours',
            description: 'Blanch bones in boiling water 10 minutes, drain and rinse. Return to clean pot with cold water, charred shallots, and charred ginger. Bring to boil, reduce to lowest simmer. Skim for 20 minutes. Simmer 1.5 hours. Meanwhile cook half the tomato wedges in annatto oil until they break down into a sauce — add this to the broth for color and depth.',
            tip: 'The pork bone broth for bánh đa cua should simmer long enough to extract collagen from the bones — this gives the broth a slightly silky body that bún riêu cua\'s shorter simmer does not achieve. 1.5 hours minimum, 2 hours preferred.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Make the chả cua — steamed crab cake',
            description: 'Combine crab meat, minced pork, beaten eggs, fish sauce, sugar, black pepper, and crispy fried shallots. Mix thoroughly. Transfer to a heatproof bowl or small loaf tin. Steam over boiling water for 20-25 minutes until set throughout — a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes before slicing into 1cm thick pieces. The chả cua should be firm, slightly springy, and visibly flecked with the fried shallots.',
            tip: 'The chả cua is steamed separately from the broth — this produces a cleaner, more defined texture than adding the raw mixture directly to the soup. The separately steamed cake slices cleanly and holds its shape in the bowl without breaking apart in the broth.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Pound the crab and make the riêu extract',
            description: 'Clean the field crabs. Pound with 250ml cold water until completely crushed. Strain through fine cloth, pressing all liquid out. Beat the eggs and mix thoroughly into the strained crab extract with fish sauce and salt. This egg-fortified crab extract will set into larger, more substantial curds than pure crab extract alone.',
            tip: 'For bánh đa cua specifically, the crab curds should be substantial — larger and firmer than in bún riêu cua. The egg ratio is slightly higher here (2 eggs to 400g crab vs 2 eggs to 500g in bún riêu) to produce this firmer curd.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Make the mắm tôm oil',
            description: 'Heat oil in a small pan. Fry minced shallots until golden. Add the shrimp paste — it will spit in the hot oil. Stir for 1 minute until the raw fermented character mellows. Add sugar. Remove from heat. Add lime juice. The finished mắm tôm oil should be fragrant, savory, and slightly sweet — it is spooned directly over each bowl immediately before serving.',
            tip: 'The mắm tôm oil is the element that takes bánh đa cua from a good noodle soup to the specific Hải Phòng experience. It is not stirred into the broth but applied per-bowl, per-serving, so each diner smells and tastes it fresh. Prepare it last so it is still warm when applied.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Add crab extract to broth and season',
            description: 'Bring the strained pork bone broth to a gentle simmer. Season with fish sauce and salt. Pour the egg-crab extract in a steady stream while stirring gently — the crab curds form immediately. Add remaining raw tomato wedges. Simmer 3 minutes only. Taste the broth: it should be clear, savory, with the sweet crab curd character distributed throughout and a slight tomato acidity.',
            tip: 'The crab extract for bánh đa cua is added to a more assertively seasoned broth than for bún riêu — the Hải Phòng version is bolder throughout. The broth should taste complete and satisfying before the toppings go in.',
        },
        {
            title: 'Cook the noodles and assemble',
            description: 'Cook soaked bánh đa noodles in boiling water 2-3 minutes until just tender — they should have a slight chew. Divide among deep bowls. Layer: sliced pork belly, sliced chả cua, sliced chả lụa. Ladle boiling broth generously, ensuring each bowl gets visible crab curds and tomato pieces. Apply 1 tablespoon of mắm tôm oil directly over the surface of each bowl — it will pool and then spread across the surface. Scatter spring onion and cilantro. Serve with bean sprouts, herbs, lime, and chili alongside.',
            tip: 'The mắm tôm oil applied last and not stirred in immediately is the serving technique that allows each diner to see and smell it before mixing it through the bowl themselves. The moment of stirring the mắm tôm oil into the soup — watching it swirl and darken the surface — is part of the bánh đa cua experience.',
